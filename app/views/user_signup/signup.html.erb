              <p>Hello,</p>
              <p>Welcome to Hobbyst!</p>
              <p>Thankyou for Joining, we are glad to know that you love food as much as we do :)</p>
              <p>In a world where food is the focal point of many a discussion, Hobbyst was born out of the quest to find you stores/places at off hours. </p>
              <p>While we are at it, weâ€™d love to hear from you and know which stores and places are open at night around you for other to find!</p>
              <br>
